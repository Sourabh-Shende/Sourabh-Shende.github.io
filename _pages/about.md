I am a current Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student advised by Prof. Kumar Vemaganti at the University of Cincinnati in computational mechanics field. My research focuses on scientific machine learning with emphasis on its application to solid mechanics problems. I have investigated data driven learning using Bayesian optimzation in the design optimization framework. Currenty, I am investigating Physics informed Machine learning (PIML) approaches for solid mechanis problems. I am particulary interested in identifying the advantages and shortcomings of PIML over well established finite element approaches.  

I also work as Graduate research assistant on research projects in collaboration with Procter & Gamble (P&G) at the UC Simulation Center. My work involves developing accurate finite element model of paper at fiber scale level. I am also responsible for developing performance tests for determing the strength of papaer. 

I earned my Master of Science (M.S.) in mechanical engineering in 2020 from the University of Cincinnati, where my research was focused on deveolping efficient Bayesian optimization algorithm to discover optimal desing solution for origami inspired folding structures.
