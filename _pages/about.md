I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/home),at Brown University, working in the group of [Prof. George Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis). I completed my Ph.D. in 2020 at [Bauhaus University, Germany](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/university/start/) under the supervision of [Prof. Timon Rabczuk](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/civil-engineering/institute/ism/team/professors/prof-dr-ing-timon-rabczuk/). My Ph.D. thesis is based on Phase field based modeling of fracture with isogeometric analysis and machine learning methods.

Here is a recent copy of my [CV](https://somdattagoswami.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).

## Research Areas
Broad Interest:  Deep Learning, Physics Driven Scientific Computing, Isogeometric Analysis

Recent works/focus on: Phase-field based modeling (Fracture Mechanics, Aortic Dissection). In particular, I have been actively involved in the design of learning machines that leverage the underlying physical laws and/or governing equations to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments.
