I am a current Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student advised by Prof. Kumar Vemaganti at the University of Cincinnati in the computational mechanics field. My research focuses on scientific machine learning with an emphasis on its application to solid mechanics problems. I have investigated data-driven learning using Bayesian optimization in the design optimization framework. Currently, I am investigating Physics informed Machine learning (PIML) approaches for solid mechanics problems. I am particularly interested in identifying the advantages and shortcomings of PIML over well-established finite element approaches.  

I also work as a Graduate research assistant on research projects in collaboration with Procter & Gamble (P&G) at the UC Simulation Center. My work involves developing an accurate finite element model of paper at the fiber scale level. I am also responsible for developing performance tests for determining the strength of the paper. 

I earned my Master of Science (M.S.) in mechanical engineering in 2020 from the University of Cincinnati, where my research was focused on developing an efficient Bayesian optimization algorithm to discover optimal design solutions for origami-inspired folding structures.
